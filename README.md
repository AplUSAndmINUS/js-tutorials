Introduction

I'm assuming that if you're here, you know what you're doing and are ready to copy down these files into your own repository. You may also download a ZIP file of the repository directly from the "Clone" button on the main repository.

Repository Cloning Steps
------------------------

Here are the instructions to clone the repository:

1. **Ensure Git is installed** to your local system along with a code editor to view the files. 
    * We recommend Visual Studio Code, found at https://code.visualstudio.com.
    * Git can be accessed from https://git-scm.com/
2. In the repository (https://github.com/AplUSAndmINUS/js-tutorials/), **click** the green "Clone" button above the repository. A dialog will appear.
3. **Copy** the link to either SSH or HTTPS download of the repository, depending on your set up. 
4. In your computer's terminal program, **navigate** to the folder where you'd like to clone the repository.

Here's a way to do that (replace *[Enter]* with the Enter key):

* **Type** in your terminal: <br />
  * cd ~/ *[Enter]* <br />
  * mkdir repos && cd repos *[Enter]*
* This creates a folder repos in your Home directory, which is usually where your user folder is located. 

5. **Type 'git clone *[copy]*'** into your terminal, replacing *[copy]* with the link you copied earlier. **Press** Enter.
6. The files will download. You can then open your code editor and begin using the files.

Node.js and package-lock.json
-----------------------------
*Important:* The package-lock.json file includes the libraries that were installed during the Node.js video tutorial. *They are in no way needed* to run the JavaScript files themselves and are simply there for reference. 

You are free to delete them on your local instance while you follow along with the Node.js module.
