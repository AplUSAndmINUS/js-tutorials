Welcome to KMDT-0230!

I'm assuming that if you're here, you know what you're doing and are ready to copy down these files into your own repository. Otherwise, you can simply download the files you need from the "Introduction" module of the course under the page titled "Supplemental Videos and Sample Code Download" (found here: https://slcc.instructure.com/courses/604970/pages/supplemental-videos-and-sample-code-download). If you do not know Git or GitHub, please close this GitHub page and return to Canvas to download the zip file there.

Otherwise, if you know how to use Git, here are the instructions to cloning the repository:

1- Ensure Git is installed to your local system along with a code editor to view the files. (We recommend Visual Studio Code, found at https://code.visualstudio.com.)

2- In the repository (https://github.com/AplUSAndmINUS/js-tutorials/), click the green "Clone" button above the repository. A dialog will appear.

3- Copy the link to either SSH or HTTPS download of the repository, depending on your set up. (I usually elect for HTTPS for simplicity unless you're using Linux.)

4- In your terminal on your computer, navigate to the folder where you'd like to clone the repository.

5- Type 'git clone <link>' into your terminal, which will clone the files to your desktop.
